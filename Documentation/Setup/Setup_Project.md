#How do I get the Plant Simulation Master Project to run?

The project requiered several quick-fixed to compile, so don't expect for it to work out of the box.

1. Download Anaconda3 or a similar tool. Anaconda is recommended as the Python environment is provided as a .yml file and can be loaded directly through anaconda.

2. In Anaconda, import the "PlantSimENV.yml" file.

3. If not present, add the path to the anaconda "scripts" directory in your system environment variables.
(In the folder "Lernender Agent", set the openAgent.md correctly. This requires setting the path to the Anaconda activate.bat (or set the Environment variable) and the path to the agent directory.) NEW WAY OF SETTING PATH!

4. Open the Plant Simulation Project and follow the presented instructions.
